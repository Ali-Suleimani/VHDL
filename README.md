# VHDL
This course is about VHDL/FPGA at KTH and includes my hands-on projects
## Course content
- Basic VHDL
- Testbenches
- Synthesis with VHDL
- Software tools: simulators and synthesis tools
- Programmable circuits (PLD, FPGA och ASIC)
- Design methods
## intended learning outcomes
- Design and evaluation of digital designs with the hardware description language VHDL using modern software tools.
- model digital systems in VHDL at different levels of abstraction
- partition a digital system into different subsystems
- simulate and verify a design
- transfer a design from a version possible to simulate to a version possible to synthesize
- use modern software tools for digital design in VHDL
- describe principal parts in programmable circuits (PLD, FPGA, ASIC) and describe how small designs are implemented in programmable circuits
